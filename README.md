# Measurement Probe Enclosures

These enclosures were designed to protect the measurement probes from environmental influences during the [5GSprint](https://5g-sprint.de/?lang=en) campaign.

We developed two types of enclosures: one designed for mounting on the Boston Dynamics Spot robot, and another intended for use on a tripod during static measurements.
